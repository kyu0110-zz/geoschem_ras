# GEOS-Chem Bleeding Edge #

This repository is the development repository of GEOS-Chem (aka the "Bleeding Edge" repo).  It is intended to share the latest code updates among developers.  It often contains untested and/or unbenchmarked code, so you should not use this to start a new GEOS-Chem project.  

## Mirrors ##

The GEOS-Chem Bleeding Edge repo is also mirrored at:

* git://git.as.harvard.edu/bmy/GC_Bleeding_Edge

So you can use this link if you have trouble downloading from BitBucket.

## Publicly-released GEOS-Chem version

If you would like to obtain the latest stable, publicly-released GEOS-Chem version (instead of the Bleeding Edge repo), you can obtain this from one of these links:

* http://bitbucket.org/gcst/geos-chem
* git://git.as.harvard.edu/bmy/GEOS-Chem

## Documentation ##

See http://manual.geos-chem.org for more information about using GEOS-Chem.
