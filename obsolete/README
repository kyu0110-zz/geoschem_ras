NOTE: The following files were used specifically in the SEAC4RS code, but
are not yet needed in the standard code.  We have "parked" them here for
the time being.  At some point in the future we may restore these:

(1) finn_biomass_mod.F
(2) flambe_biomass_mod.F
(3) ncdf_mod.F
(4) nei2008_anthro_mod.F

Everything else in this directory is really, truly obsolete and has been
removed from the code at some point in the past.
